// Unlike build flags in the typical GN sense, this file hard-codes a flag.
// Doing it in this (non-dynamic) way prevents us from having to declare
// additional GN deps in our and upstream's code. We don't lose much because the
// flag defined here is not meant to be changed dynamically with `gn gen`. At
// the same time, we get the benefits associated with BUILDFLAG(...). And we
// reduce duplicate code by coding the conditions for when the flag should be
// activated only once, in this file. Finally, the introduction of the new
// identifier makes it very easy to search the code base for its occurrences,
// for the case when the flag becomes obsolete in the future and needs to be
// removed.
